## Overview

FindWeb is a modern, client-side meta-search tool designed to simplify finding direct download links. It leverages the power of advanced search engine "dorks" (like `intitle:"index of"`) to scan open directories for files.

It provides a clean, "glassmorphism" interface to build and execute powerful search queries across multiple search engines, all from a single, lightweight HTML file.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Sleek, Modern UI:** A beautiful "glassmorphism" design that looks great.
* **Fully Responsive:** Perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **Light & Dark Mode:** Automatic theme detection based on your system preferences, with a manual toggle.
* **Multi-Engine Search:** Query Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, StartPage, and FilePursuit.
* **File Type Filtering:** Quickly search for Video, Audio, Ebooks, Software/Archives, and more.
* **Zero Backend:** No server, no tracking, no logs. It's just a single, fast HTML file.
* **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and host yourself.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** For the core structure.
* **Bootstrap 5:** For the responsive grid and base components.
* **Bootstrap Icons:** For the clean icon set.
* **Vanilla CSS:** Custom properties (variables) for "glassmorphism" styling and theme switching.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** To power the theme toggle and search logic.
